# Boston House Pricing Prediction

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a predictive model that estimates house prices in Boston based on various features like crime rate, average number of rooms, and property tax rate. Using machine learning techniques, we created a model that can assist in understanding how different factors influence house prices in the area.

The model has been deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to input specific values and instantly get a predicted house price. You can check out the live app here: [Boston House Pricing Prediction App](https://boston-house-pricing-013.streamlit.app/).
